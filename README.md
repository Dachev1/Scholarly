<h1>Summary</h1>
As students of PGDS "Tsar Ivan Asen II", we wanted not only to observe how the school is modernized and changed, but also to support this process by implementing a conceptual project for easier buying and selling of textbooks and educational literature. The Internet application we created is an electronic platform for publishing ads for the sale of textbooks, with a description, photo, price and the possibility of messages between users, which facilitate the purchase and sale. 
It is implemented through PHP, MySQL database, HTML and CSS. It has a modern web interface that is customizable for different devices (computer, tablet, smartphone), with features such as chatting, viewing, publishing products (textbooks, literature) sorted by classes, subjects or specialties.
